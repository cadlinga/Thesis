\textbf{Declaration}
\end{center}

I declare that this dissertation was composed entirely by myself.

% Chapters 2 and 3 provide an introduction to the subject area and a
% description of previous work on this topic. They do not contain
% original research.
%
% Chapter~4 describes work that was carried out entirely by me. The results of
% this chapter have been obtained previously by Professor Anne T Matta of the
% University of Kinlochteuchter, but the methods used here are different
% in some important (or minor) ways.
%
% Chapters 4 through 6 contain my original work. The work described in
% Chapter~4 was carried out in collaboration with Professor Carole Ann O'Malley
% and her PhD student Jack O'Bean. Chapter~5 presents original work done
% entirely by me.

% State whether calculations were done using Mathematica, Maple, MATLAB,
% SymPy, etc, with (or without) gamma-matrix manipulation code, master
% integrals, the Super-Duper software package, etc. In other words, you
% should refer to any software that you used during your project. For
% example, Monte Carlo simulation packages, hydrodynamics packages,
% measurement code, fitting code, tensor algebra and/or calculus packages,
% Feynman diagram evaluation packages, etc.
%
% State whether any software you used was written by you from scratch,
% by your supervisor (or by whoever), or if it's a standard package.
