I'd like to thank my supervisor \textbf{Professor Cristian Bonato} for
making this project possible, I am particularly grateful for his
patience and his ability to make complex subjects seem approachable and achievable. 

\bigskip 

I would also like to thank the Royal Air Force \textbf{Director of Defence Studies} and the \textbf{Chief of the Air Staff} 
for supporting my completion of this research and I look forward to applying what I have learned to my time in service. 


\bigskip 

Most of all I would like to thank my wife \textbf{Sophie} for her ongoing support and patience. I could not have completed this work without your help.

% This document has its origins in the dissertation template for the MSc
% in High Performance Computing, which is apparently descended from a
% template developed by Professor Charles Duncan for MSc students in
% Meteorology. His acknowledgement follows:
%
% \emph{This template has been produced with help from many former
%   students who have shown different ways of doing things. Please make
%   suggestions for further improvements.}
%
% Some parts of this template were lifted unashamedly from the Edinburgh
% MPhys project report guide, with little or no modification. I have no
% idea who wrote the first version of that\ldots
%
% You don't have to use \LaTeX\ for your dissertation. You can use
% Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, LibreOffice or similar, but it's
% \emph{much} easier to typeset equations in \LaTeX, and references look
% after themselves. Whatever you use, your dissertation should have the
% general structure of this template, and it should look similar --
% especially the front page.
