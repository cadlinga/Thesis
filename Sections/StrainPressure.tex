\subsection{Strain}

% Two physical effects contribute to stark parameters $d_\parallel$ and $d_\perp$. 
% Electric fields distort the positions of atoms in the SiC lattice neighboring
% the divacancy and electric fields shift the electron

Strain, which alters the $D$ and $E$ parameters due to a distribution in the ligand field \cite{Jeschke} will influence the Hamiltonian, specifically the zero field splitting of the spin system. Using the same reasoning as
in section \ref{stark}, we could derive a strain Hamiltonian which is identical to \eqref{eq:stark_hamiltonian}.
Therefore, exactly as we consider the "whole effect" of the contributions to the zero field Hamiltonian, we consider
the combined effect of strain and applied $\vec{E}$. Put simply, \index{strain}{strain} is treated as an effective electric
field \cite{PhysRevLett.112.187601}.

An application of this duality, is that we may use $\vec{E}$ measuring techniques in shielded environment to determine strain.

\subsection{Pressure}
The effect of \index{pressure}{pressure} has been studied for SiC divacancies. The zero field splitting parameter $D$ shows 
a linear dependence on pressure up to $40$ GPa \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03378} and is shown in figure \ref{fig:pressure_d}.

\end{figure}

This allows for the consideration of the pressure applied to the system which allows for sensing in environments above ambient pressure. Additionally, if other parameters are held constant or the sensor is designed such that they cannot contribute (e.g. electro-magnetic shielding) the system can be utilised as a pressure gauge.
