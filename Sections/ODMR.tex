\section{ODMR}
% The results suggest that magnetic field sensing sensitivity can be greatly improved for the optimized laser and microwave power range.

% We measure increased photoluminescence from divacancy ensembles by up to three orders of magnitude using near-ultraviolet excitation, depending on the substrate, and without degrading the electron spin coherence time.
