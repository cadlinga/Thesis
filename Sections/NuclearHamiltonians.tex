\section{Nuclear Hamiltonians}\label{nuclear}
\tdr{Decide how in depth these derivations should be. }
There are three additional contributions to the Hamiltonian to be considered which involve an interaction with the nucleus.

\subsection{\index{Zeeman!nuclear zeeman}{Nuclear Zeeman}}
Equivalent to electron Zeeman but for the nuclear magnetic moment. 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\ce{Zeeman(n)}} = -g_n \mu_n \vec{B} \cdot \hat{\vec{I}}
    \label{eq:nuclear_zeeman_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

\subsection{\index{hyperfine interaction}{Hyperfine Interaction}}
Equivalent to Fine Structure (ZFS) but between the nuclear and electron moment. 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\ce{Hyperfine}} = \hat{\vec{S}} \cdot A \cdot \hat{\vec{I}}
    \label{eq:hyperfine_hamiltonian_dense}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    H_{\ce{Hyperfine}} = A_\parallel \hat{S}_z\hat{I}_z + A_\perp(\hat{S}_y\hat{I}_y + \hat{S}_z\hat{I}_z)
    \label{eq:hyperfine_hamiltonian_componentwise}
\end{equation}
For the systems discussed in this work, hyperfine couplings are usually too small to detect, 
thus manifest as inhomogeneous line broadening \cite{SpinStates}. Thus, we do not include the hyperfine contribution 
for the remainder of this work. 

\subsection{\index{nuclear quadrupole}{Nuclear Quadrupole}}
Equivalent to the electron dipole-dipole but for the nuclear magnetic moment. 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\ce{Quadrupole}} = \hat{\vec{I}} \cdot Q \cdot \hat{\vec{I}}
    \label{eq:nuclear_quadrupole}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Nuclear Summary}
We have chosen to include the nuclear Hamiltonians for completeness, but will now disregard them in the rest of this work since.
