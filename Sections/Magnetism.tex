\section{Magnetism}
Where charge ($\vec{E}$-field) has an elementary source unit of a point charge (or monopole) which may be positively or negatively charged. Conversely the elementary source unit of magnetism ($\vec{B}$-field) is the \index{magnetic dipole}. \index{Magnetic monopole}s have never been observed; their existence would also violate Gauss law ($\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{B} = 0 $).
