\section{Spin-Orbit Interaction}
The orbital magnetic dipole may interact with the intrinsic spin magnetic dipole via the \index{spin-orbit interaction}{spin-orbit interaction}. This is represented by the spin-orbit Hamiltonian with $\lambda$ representing the constant of the coupling: 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\ce{SO}} = \lambda \hat{\vec{L}}\cdot\hat{\vec{S}}. 
    \label{eq:spin_orbit_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

This is caused by the interaction between the magnetic field induced by the electrons relativistic orbit of the nucleus and its intrinsic spin.
