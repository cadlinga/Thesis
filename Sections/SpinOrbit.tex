\section{Spin-Orbit Interaction}
The orbital magnetic dipole may interact with the intrinsic spin magnetic dipole via the \index{spin-orbit interaction}{spin-orbit interaction}. This is represented by the spin-orbit Hamiltonian with $\lambda$ representing the constant of the coupling: 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\ce{SO}} = \lambda \hat{\vec{L}}\cdot\hat{\vec{S}}. 
    \label{eq:spin_orbit_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

This is caused by the interaction between the magnetic field generated by the relativistic motion of the electron around the nucleus and that of the spin magnetic moment. The coupling is proportional to the atomic mass.
