\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}
In this chapter we will provide an overview of how the defects in SiC can be used for \index{magnetometry}{magnetometry}, \index{thermometry}{thermometry} and \index{electrometry}{electrometry} in isolation. We will then develop a framework where by combining specific defects we may simultaneously measure multiple parameters.
