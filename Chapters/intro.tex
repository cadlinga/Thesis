\chapter{Introduction}

% The Introduction should contain a description of your project and the
% problem you are trying to solve. It should start off at a level that
% should be understandable by anyone with a degree in physics, but it
% can become more technical later
%
% Where appropriate you should include references to work that has
% already been done on your topic and anything else which lets you set
% your work in context.
%
% One of the things you will need to do is to ensure that you have a
% suitable list of references.  To do this you should see \cite{Simon2013-lh}
% or some other suitable reference.  Note the format of the citation used
% here is the style favoured in this School.  Here is another
% reference \cite{Simon2013-lh} for good measure.
%
%
% You will also want to make sure you have no spelling or grammatical
% mistakes. To help identify speling mistukes you can use the commands
% \emph{aspell}, \emph{ispell} or \emph{spell} on most Linux/Unix
% computers. See the appropriate manual pages. Remember that spelling
% mistakes are not the only errors which can occur. Spelling checkers
% will not find errors which are, in fact, valid words such as
% \emph{there} for {\em their}, nor will they find repeated repeated
% words which sometimes occur if your concentration is broken when
% typing. \textbf{There is no substitute for thorough proof reading!}
%
% Your dissertation should be no longer than 15,000 words. In terms of
% pages, 30 pages are ok. 50 pages are fine. But it shouldn't be
% much longer than that.
