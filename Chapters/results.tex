\chapter{Results and Analysis}\label{ch:results}

Overall, the scope of multimodality which can be achieved depends very heavily on the complex interconnection of the parameter influence. Often, by constraining a freedom of one of the parameters the interplay is significantly simplified and allows for multimodal measurement. This is of course still relevant as many physical systems for which nanoscale sensors of this kind will be useful will have predictable characteristics. 

It has been shown in this work that by controlling other factors, defects in silicon carbide may be used as quantum sensors to detect both the electric and magnetic fields, pressure, strain and temperature. 

For multimodal sensing without constraint, the temperature independence of the ZFS $D$ parameter in the V2 Silicon vacancy showed the most obvious application. As briefly mentioned, further research into the interplay between temperature and any other characteristic will expand the scope of what it is possible to simultaneously sense. 

This allowed for sensing of magnetic field and temperature simultaneously - possibly even with the same defect family. With a long enough integration time, so assuming a steady state system, this measurement could potentially be made using only a single defect.

For constrained multimodal sensing, three more schemas were developed which exploit the reduction in complexity when the off diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian are reduced by precise field alignment. 

\todo[inline]{discuss each scheme 1 by 1, images?}

Without a developed schema for $\vec{E}$ field measurement with a $S=3/2$ system, the temperature stable ZFS $D$ was not able to be exploited and so we were not able to determine an unconstrained method for multimodal sensing involving the $\vec{E}$ field. 

An approach considered in this work, albeit unsuccessful was to attempt to reduce the ambiguity within some of the systems by comparing the effects on basal and c-axis defects. Similar schemes are used with the Diamond nitrogen vacancy, however that system has four distinct defect orientations and so integration into three dimensional space is overdetermined. Conversely for SiC there are only two distinct orientations and thus integration into three dimensional space is underdetermined. Further, at temperatures above cryogenic, some of the alternative defects produce very low contrast. Thus, in the context of multimodality, even if solved, the technique would likely be inappropriate. 


% \subsection{Successful}
% Here we discuss the proposed systems which could be successfully implemented using the techniques described in this work. 
% \subsubsection{$\vec{B}$ and Temperature}
% The fact that the V2 Silicon vacancy shows little to no correlation between the ZFS $D$ parameter and temperature makes it 
% extremely useful for multimodal sensing. The ODMR spectra of the  defect is effectively blind to temperature allowing it to be 
% paired with another defect (or technique) very easily. 
%
% \missingifigure{Plot showing ODMR simulated spectra at $B$ constant, $T$ varied (showing no difference). }
%
% The fact that the anti-Stokes measurement of temperature depends strongly on the position of the zero phonon line, which is determined by $D$ allows for the use of a single defect type to measure both parameters. This single defect dependence allowed for the discussion of tri-modal sensing which is discussed at the end of this chapter. 
%
% Further, the stability of the $D$ parameter is what enables the anti-Stokes method to be employed (and hinders other systems). 
% The method relies on using two lasers of wavelengths strictly larger and smaller than the zero phonon line. If $D$ was varying, laser frequencies would have to be adjusted on the fly, may be technically possible, but limits the utility of the system.

% \subsection{High Potential}
% The obvious high potential multimodal system is a temperature pressure measurement. 
% The applications of such a sensor are obvious and immediate.

% This section should detail the obtained results in a clear,
% easy-to-follow manner. It is important to make clear what are original
% results and what are repeats of previous calculations or computations.
% Remember that long tables of numbers are just as boring to read as
% they are to type-in!
%
% Use graphs to present your results wherever practicable.
%
% Results or computations should be presented with uncertainties
% (errors), both statistical and systematic where applicable.
%
% Be selective in what you include: half a dozen \emph{e.g.}~tables that
% contain wrong data you collected while you forgot to switch on the
% computer are not relevant and may mask the correct results.

%
% \section{Some results}
% Here are some results.
%
% \subsection{More results}
% When showing results you are likely to use tables and graphs. You can
% create tables easily in \LaTeX.
%
% \begin{table}[h]
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{||l|c|l||}
% \hline
% \textbf{File names} & \textbf{Satellite} & \textbf{Resolution}\\
% \hline
%   worldr            &  Meteosat          &   5km\\
%   worldg            &  Meteosat          &   5km\\
%   worldb            &  Meteosat          &   5km\\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \caption{This is a simple table. More complicated tables can have
%   headings which pass over more than one column. The caption should
%   explain exactly in some detail what is displayed in the table.}
% \label{simple_table}
% \end{table}
%
% If you want to produce fancier tables than shown in Table \ref{simple_table}
% refer to the \LaTeX\ manual or ask Madame La Google.
%
% One of the simplest ways to produce simple graphs is to use gnuplot
% which produces \LaTeX\  output. Graph~(\ref{fig:gnu}) was produced using
% gnuplot with output designated as \LaTeX\  so that a \LaTeX\  output file is
% produced which you can include directly or keep separate and refer to
% using the \emph{include} command.
%
% Another approach is to draw simple figures using \emph{xfig} which allows
% you to export diagrams in \LaTeX\  picture format so that the diagram can
% be included directly.
%
% Perhaps the most robust way to include graphs is to convert them to
% PostScript or PDF and include them in the same was as was done in
% Figure~\ref{fig:eucrest} for the University Crest. You can usually do
% this with most packages, including Microsoft ones; one trick for
% producing PostScript is to print to a dummy PostScript printer.
%
% % in practice you would probably keep this in a separate file and use
% % the \include{filename} command to insert it here.
