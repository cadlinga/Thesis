    abstract = {This paper summarizes recent studies identifying key qubit
                systems in silicon carbide (SiC) for quantum sensing of magnetic,
                electric fields, and temperature at the nano and microscale. The
                properties of colour centres in SiC, that can be used for quantum
                sensing, are reviewed with a focus on paramagnetic colour centres
                and their spin Hamiltonians describing Zeeman splitting, Stark
                effect, and hyperfine interactions. These properties are then
                mapped onto various methods for their initialization, control,
                and read-out. We then summarised methods used for a spin and
                charge state control in various colour centres in SiC. These
                properties and methods are then described in the context of
                quantum sensing applications in magnetometry, thermometry, and
                electrometry. Current state-of-the art sensitivities are compiled
                and approaches to enhance the sensitivity are proposed. The large
                variety of methods for control and read-out, combined with the
ability to scale this material in integrated photonics chips
                operating in harsh environments, places SiC at the forefront of
                future quantum sensing technology based on semiconductors.},

                high-temperature, high-power, high-frequency, and radiation
                hardened applications, has emerged as the most mature of the
                wide-bandgap (2.0 eV ≲ Eg ≲ 7.0 eV) semiconductors since the
                release of commercial 6HSiC bulk substrates in 1991 and 4HSiC
                substrates in 1994. Following a brief introduction to SiC
                material properties, the status of SiC in terms of bulk crystal
                growth, unit device fabrication processes, device performance,
                circuits and sensors is discussed. Emphasis is placed upon
                demonstrated high-temperature applications, such as power
                transistors and rectifiers, turbine engine combustion monitoring,
                temperature sensors, analog and digital circuitry, flame
                detectors, and accelerometers. While individual device
                performances have been impressive (e.g. 4HSiC MESFETs with fmax
                of 42 GHz and over 2.8 W mm−1 power density; 4HSiC static
                induction transistors with 225 W power output at 600 MHz, 47%

                remain the primary impediment to wide-spread application in
                commercial markets. Micropipe defect densities have been reduced
                from near the 1000 cm−2 order of magnitude in 1992 to 3.5 cm−2 at
                the research level in 1995.},

                fabrication and micro/nano-processing technologies have recently
                drawn considerable attention. Although room-temperature
                single-spin manipulation of colour centres in SiC has been
                demonstrated, the typically detected contrast is less than 2\\$\\
                \\%\\$, and the photon count rate is also low. Here, we present
                the coherent manipulation of single divacancy spins in 4H-SiC
                with a high readout contrast (\\$-30\\\\%\\$) and a high photon
                count rate (150 kilo counts per second) under ambient conditions,
                which are competitive with the nitrogen-vacancy centres in
                diamond. Coupling between a single defect spin and a nearby
                nuclear spin is also observed. We further provide a theoretical
                explanation for the high readout contrast by analysing the defect
                levels and decay paths. Since the high readout contrast is of
                utmost importance in many applications of quantum technologies,
                this work might open a new territory for SiC-based quantum

               (SiC) is single-shot readout, a deterministic measurement of the
               quantum state. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of
               single defects in SiC via spin-to-charge conversion, whereby the
               defect's spin state is mapped onto a long-lived charge state.
               With this technique, we achieve over 80\% readout fidelity
               without pre- or postselection, resulting in a high
               signal-to-noise ratio that enables us to measure long spin
               coherence times. Combined with pulsed dynamical decoupling
               sequences in an isotopically purified host material, we report
               single-spin T2 > 5 seconds, over two orders of magnitude greater
               than previously reported in this system. The mapping of these
               coherent spin states onto single charges unlocks both
               single-shot readout for scalable quantum nodes and opportunities

  abstract  = "Abstract Silicon carbide has recently surged as an alternative
               material for scalable and integrated quantum photonics, as it is
               a host for naturally occurring color centers within its bandgap,
               emitting from the UV to the IR even at telecom wavelength. Some
               of these color centers have been proved to be characterized by
               quantum properties associated with their single-photon emission
               and their coherent spin state control, which make them ideal for
               quantum technology, such as quantum communication, computation,
               quantum sensing, metrology and can constitute the elements of
               future quantum networks. Due to its outstanding electrical,
               mechanical, and optical properties which extend to optical
               nonlinear properties, silicon carbide can also supply a more
               amenable platform for photonics devices with respect to other
               wide bandgap semiconductors, being already an unsurpassed
               material for high power microelectronics. In this review, we
               will summarize the current findings on this material color
               centers quantum properties such as quantum emission via optical
               and electrical excitation, optical spin polarization and
               coherent spin control and manipulation. Their fabrication
               methods are also summarized, showing the need for on-demand and
               nanometric control of the color centers fabrication location in
               the material. Their current applications in single-photon
               sources, quantum sensing of strain, magnetic and electric
               fields, spin-photon interface are also described. Finally, the
               efforts in the integration of these color centers in photonics
               devices and their fabrication challenges are described.",

  abstract  = "Long coherence times are key to the performance of quantum bits
               (qubits). Here, we experimentally and theoretically show that
               the Hahn-echo coherence time of electron spins associated with
               divacancy defects in 4H-SiC reaches 1.3 ms, one of the longest
               Hahn-echo coherence times of an electron spin in a naturally
               isotopic crystal. Using a first-principles microscopic
               quantum-bath model, we find that two factors determine the
               unusually robust coherence. First, in the presence of moderate
               magnetic fields (30 mT and above), the 29Si and 13C paramagnetic
               nuclear spin baths are decoupled. In addition, because SiC is a
               binary crystal, homo-nuclear spin pairs are both diluted and
               forbidden from forming strongly coupled, nearest-neighbour spin
               pairs. Longer neighbour distances result in fewer nuclear spin
               flip-flops, a less fluctuating intra-crystalline magnetic
               environment, and thus a longer coherence time. Our results point
               to polyatomic crystals as promising hosts for coherent qubits in
               the solid state.",

abstract  ="Color centers in silicon carbide have become potentially versatile quantum sensors. Particularly{,} wide temperature-range temperature sensing has been realized in recent years. However{,} the sensitivity is limited due to the short dephasing time of the color centers. In this work{,} we developed a high-sensitivity silicon carbide divacancy-based thermometer using the thermal Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (TCPMG) method. First{,} the zero-field splitting D of the PL6 divacancy as a function of temperature was measured with a linear slope of −99.7 kHz K−1. The coherence times of TCPMG pulses linearly increased with the pulse number and the longest coherence time was about 21 μs{,} which was ten times higher than . The corresponding temperature-sensing sensitivity was 13.4 mK Hz−1/2{,} which was about 15 times higher than previous results. Finally{,} we monitored the laboratory temperature variations for 24 hours using the TCMPG pulse. The experiments pave the way for the application of silicon carbide-based high-sensitivity thermometers in the semiconductor industry{,} biology{,} and materials sciences."}

abstract = {Divacancy in silicon carbide has become an important solid-state system for quantum metrologies. To make it more beneficial for practical applications, we realize a fiber-coupled divacancy-based magnetometer and thermometer simultaneously. First, we realize an efficient coupling between the divacancy in a silicon carbide slice with a multimode fiber. Then the optimization of the power broadening in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of divacancy is performed to obtain a higher sensing sensitivity of 3.9 \&\#x03BC;T/Hz1/2. We then use it to detect the strength of an external magnetic field. Finally, we use the Ramsey methods to realize a temperature sensing with a sensitivity of 163.2 mK/Hz1/2. The experiments demonstrate that the compact fiber-coupled divacancy quantum sensor can be used for multiple practical quantum sensing.},
