    abstract = {This paper summarizes recent studies identifying key qubit
                systems in silicon carbide (SiC) for quantum sensing of magnetic,
                electric fields, and temperature at the nano and microscale. The
                properties of colour centres in SiC, that can be used for quantum
                sensing, are reviewed with a focus on paramagnetic colour centres
                and their spin Hamiltonians describing Zeeman splitting, Stark
                effect, and hyperfine interactions. These properties are then
                mapped onto various methods for their initialization, control,
                and read-out. We then summarised methods used for a spin and
                charge state control in various colour centres in SiC. These
                properties and methods are then described in the context of
                quantum sensing applications in magnetometry, thermometry, and
                electrometry. Current state-of-the art sensitivities are compiled
                and approaches to enhance the sensitivity are proposed. The large
                variety of methods for control and read-out, combined with the
                ability to scale this material in integrated photonics chips
                operating in harsh environments, places SiC at the forefront of
                future quantum sensing technology based on semiconductors.},

                high-temperature, high-power, high-frequency, and radiation
                hardened applications, has emerged as the most mature of the
                wide-bandgap (2.0 eV ≲ Eg ≲ 7.0 eV) semiconductors since the
                release of commercial 6HSiC bulk substrates in 1991 and 4HSiC
                substrates in 1994. Following a brief introduction to SiC
                material properties, the status of SiC in terms of bulk crystal
                growth, unit device fabrication processes, device performance,
                circuits and sensors is discussed. Emphasis is placed upon
                demonstrated high-temperature applications, such as power
                transistors and rectifiers, turbine engine combustion monitoring,
                temperature sensors, analog and digital circuitry, flame
                detectors, and accelerometers. While individual device
                performances have been impressive (e.g. 4HSiC MESFETs with fmax
                of 42 GHz and over 2.8 W mm−1 power density; 4HSiC static
                induction transistors with 225 W power output at 600 MHz, 47%
                power added efficiency (PAE), and 200 V forward blocking voltage)

                remain the primary impediment to wide-spread application in
                commercial markets. Micropipe defect densities have been reduced
                from near the 1000 cm−2 order of magnitude in 1992 to 3.5 cm−2 at
                the research level in 1995.},

                fabrication and micro/nano-processing technologies have recently
                drawn considerable attention. Although room-temperature
                single-spin manipulation of colour centres in SiC has been
                demonstrated, the typically detected contrast is less than 2\\$\\
                \\%\\$, and the photon count rate is also low. Here, we present
                the coherent manipulation of single divacancy spins in 4H-SiC
                with a high readout contrast (\\$-30\\\\%\\$) and a high photon
                count rate (150 kilo counts per second) under ambient conditions,
                which are competitive with the nitrogen-vacancy centres in
                diamond. Coupling between a single defect spin and a nearby
                nuclear spin is also observed. We further provide a theoretical
                explanation for the high readout contrast by analysing the defect
                levels and decay paths. Since the high readout contrast is of
                utmost importance in many applications of quantum technologies,
                this work might open a new territory for SiC-based quantum

    abstract = "An outstanding hurdle for defect spin qubits in silicon carbide
                (SiC) is single-shot readout, a deterministic measurement of the
                quantum state. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of single
                defects in SiC via spin-to-charge conversion, whereby the
                defect's spin state is mapped onto a long-lived charge state.
                With this technique, we achieve over 80\% readout fidelity
                without pre- or postselection, resulting in a high
                signal-to-noise ratio that enables us to measure long spin
                coherence times. Combined with pulsed dynamical decoupling
                sequences in an isotopically purified host material, we report
                single-spin T2 > 5 seconds, over two orders of magnitude greater
                than previously reported in this system. The mapping of these
                coherent spin states onto single charges unlocks both single-shot
                readout for scalable quantum nodes and opportunities for
                electrical readout via integration with semiconductor devices.",

    title = "Silicon carbide color centers for quantum applications",
    author = "Castelletto, Stefania and Boretti, Alberto",
    abstract = "Abstract Silicon carbide has recently surged as an alternative
                material for scalable and integrated quantum photonics, as it is
                a host for naturally occurring color centers within its bandgap,
                emitting from the UV to the IR even at telecom wavelength. Some
                of these color centers have been proved to be characterized by
                quantum properties associated with their single-photon emission
                and their coherent spin state control, which make them ideal for
                quantum technology, such as quantum communication, computation,
                quantum sensing, metrology and can constitute the elements of
                future quantum networks. Due to its outstanding electrical,
                mechanical, and optical properties which extend to optical
                nonlinear properties, silicon carbide can also supply a more
                amenable platform for photonics devices with respect to other
                wide bandgap semiconductors, being already an unsurpassed
                material for high power microelectronics. In this review, we will
                summarize the current findings on this material color centers
                quantum properties such as quantum emission via optical and
                electrical excitation, optical spin polarization and coherent
                spin control and manipulation. Their fabrication methods are also
                summarized, showing the need for on-demand and nanometric control
                of the color centers fabrication location in the material. Their
                current applications in single-photon sources, quantum sensing of
                strain, magnetic and electric fields, spin-photon interface are
                also described. Finally, the efforts in the integration of these

    abstract = "Long coherence times are key to the performance of quantum bits
                (qubits). Here, we experimentally and theoretically show that the
                Hahn-echo coherence time of electron spins associated with
                divacancy defects in 4H-SiC reaches 1.3 ms, one of the longest
                Hahn-echo coherence times of an electron spin in a naturally
                isotopic crystal. Using a first-principles microscopic
                quantum-bath model, we find that two factors determine the
                unusually robust coherence. First, in the presence of moderate
                magnetic fields (30 mT and above), the 29Si and 13C paramagnetic
                nuclear spin baths are decoupled. In addition, because SiC is a
                binary crystal, homo-nuclear spin pairs are both diluted and
                forbidden from forming strongly coupled, nearest-neighbour spin
                pairs. Longer neighbour distances result in fewer nuclear spin
                flip-flops, a less fluctuating intra-crystalline magnetic
                environment, and thus a longer coherence time. Our results point
                to polyatomic crystals as promising hosts for coherent qubits in
                the solid state.",

abstract = {Divacancy in silicon carbide has become an important solid-state system for quantum metrologies. To make it more beneficial for practical applications, we realize a fiber-coupled divacancy-based magnetometer and thermometer simultaneously. First, we realize an efficient coupling between the divacancy in a silicon carbide slice with a multimode fiber. Then the optimization of the power broadening in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of divacancy is performed to obtain a higher sensing sensitivity of 3.9 \&\#x03BC;T/Hz1/2. We then use it to detect the strength of an external magnetic field. Finally, we use the Ramsey methods to realize a temperature sensing with a sensitivity of 163.2 mK/Hz1/2. The experiments demonstrate that the compact fiber-coupled divacancy quantum sensor can be used for multiple practical quantum sensing.},
